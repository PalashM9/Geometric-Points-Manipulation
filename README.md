# Geometric Points Manipulation

## Overview
This Python project focuses on generating and manipulating sets of points for geometric or mathematical analyses. It includes functionalities for creating random points within specified ranges and possibly other point-related operations.

## Features
- Generation of a set of random points within given bounds.
- Additional functionalities related to points manipulation (full details can be found in the code documentation).

## Usage
To run the script:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run `main.py` in your Python environment.

The script will execute the defined point generation and manipulation tasks.

## Implementation Details
- `main.py`: Contains the primary logic for point generation and manipulation.
- `Points` class: Responsible for the creation and handling of point sets.
    - `generate_random_points`: Method to generate a set of random points.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Additional dependencies can be found in the script's import statements.
